                <h2>Our Story: Turning a Page üìñ</h2>
                <p><strong>Driven by a passion for print, our bookstore journey began in 2015.</strong> We saw a gap in the market for a cozy, curated space where readers could truly connect with books, not just buy them. What started as a single shelf in a coffee shop has grown into your favorite local literary hub.</p>
                <p>Every book sold, every author event hosted, is a testament to the loyalty of our customers and our commitment to the enduring magic of the physical book.</p>

                <h2>Our Literary Curation and Selection üîé</h2>
                <p>Unlike big-box stores, every book on our shelf is chosen with intention. Our curation process focuses on <strong>quality, diversity, and literary merit</strong>. We pride ourselves on discovering hidden gems and offering well-loved classics.</p>
                <p>Our selection is constantly evolving, guided by these three principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Ensuring we have essential works in every major genre.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Highlighting authors from underrepresented backgrounds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Hand-picking new, exciting voices we believe in.</li>
